            A form of high <b>intensity interval training</b>, CrossFit is a strength and conditioning workout that is made up of functional movement performed at a high intensity level.
            These movements are actions that you perform in your day-to-day life, like <b>squatting, pulling, pushing</b> etc. Many workouts feature variations of squats, push-ups, and weight lifting that last for predetermined amounts of time to help build muscles.
            This varies from a traditional workout that may tell you how many reps to do over any period of time.
